This library implements a *lifecycle* approach inspired by [Choi et al. (2024)](https://www.nber.org/papers/w34166): your future earning power (human capital) acts like a bond, and accounting for it changes how much stock risk you should take.\n\nThis tutorial walks through the full library in ~10 minutes.\n\n> **Disclaimer:** This is for education and research. It is not investment advice."
